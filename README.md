Project done in June 2022 for TOP's "shopping cart" exercise. I didn't wanted to lose time on thinking over a design and decided to recreate one of my close friend's existing, operational site; built with existing templates.

The project is still unfinished. It requires animations, a homepage, better responsiveness and carousels for item views BUT it provided a decent challenge. Made everything from the scratch and it proved to be a good exercise regarding frontend code.

Original site that I tried to recreate is www.sommeslovi.com
